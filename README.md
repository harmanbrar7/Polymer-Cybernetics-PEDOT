# Polymer-Cybernetics-PEDOT
Latex paper on enhancing medical implants and tissue connectivity (biological-physics integration)

The combination of biological tissue and physical hardware is a phenomena that can
potentially push the bounds of human evolution. Though the time frame of this evo-
lution is much debated, certain precursors do exist. Cybernetic polymers are one such
experimental technique that allow for the integration of biological species and physical me-
chanics. Polymers are instrumental in combining electronic hardware and human tissue,
specifically, conjugated polymers that are both electrically and ionically active. 

Main focus on PEDOT potentials and electrical engineering in conjuction with the human body.
